You installed agents on all workstations and servers, Windows, Linux, macOS, and began to ingest not only logs but process names, file hashes, commandline arguments, everything under the sun! You used existing parsers or wrote new ones, created gorgeous visualizations and dashboards, complete with histograms and world maps, fully interactive.
